# Frontend Mentor - clipboard-landing-page

I coded this lading-page for a clipboard web-app myself and the layout was designed bij Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor provides challenges for frontend developers so they can make projects without the problem of designing the project. [See the challenge on Frontend Mentor.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9)

## The challenge

The challenge was to make a clipboard-landing-page as close to the design as possible. They provided a style-guide with the colors, font and screenshots of the design. Also a screenshot with active states was attached.

## Screenshots

<img src="screenshots/screenshot-desktop1.png" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-desktop2.png" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-desktop3.png" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-ipad1.png" style="width:70%;" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-ipad2.png" style="width:70%;" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-mobile1.png" style="width:50%;" alt=""/>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-mobile2.png" style="width:50%;"/>
<br></br>

## My experience

This time the buttons were a bit challenging. I hope they now look as close as possible to the design. It was hard to see how they were made out of a screenshot. Making the design also look well on other screens then desktop format had it's challenges and I learned a lot from it.
